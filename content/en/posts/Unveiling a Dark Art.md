Welcome to the shadows of the digital world, where hidden threats lurk and vulnerabilities are exploited.  In this interconnected world, technology seamlessly intertwines with our everyday lives and we find ourselves vulnerable to the vastly growing breed of cyber threat:  social engineering.  While many are familiar with the concept on a surface level, there are crucial aspects often overlooked.


## Well-Known Attack Vectors

- Phishing:  Phishing emails are a classic, yet effective tactic employed by social engineers.  These deceptive messages mimic legitimate communication, urging unsuspecting victims to click on malicious links, share credentials, or unknowingly install malware.
- Pretexting/Baiting:  This technique involves creating a fabricated scenario or pretext to manipulate individuals into revealing sensitive information.  For instance, an attacker might impersonate a co-worker or IT support personnel to gain access to confidential data or network resources.
- Vishing (Voice Phishing):  Vishing involves using phone calls or voicemail messages to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information.  The attacker may pose as a bank representative, government official, or technical support agent to gain the victim’s trust.
- Tailgating/Piggybacking:  In physical environments, tailgating involves unauthorized individuals following authorized personnel into restricted areas.  Social engineers exploit this by leveraging the natural inclination to hold doors open for others, bypassing security controls and infiltrating restricted spaces.

## Lesser-Known Attack Vectors

- Quid Pro Quo Attacks:  In this technique, the attacker offers something of value in exchange for sensitive information or access.  For instance, a social engineer might pose as an IT support agent, offering to troubleshoot an issue remotely in return for login credentials or other confidential data.
- Reverse Social Engineering:  In this crafty approach, the attacker poses as a legitimate individual who manipulates their victims into initiating contact with them, placing the attacker in a position of perceived trust and authority.  This inversion of roles often catches victims off-guard, making them more susceptible to deception.
Watering Hole Attacks:  Social engineers target specific websites or online communities that are frequently visited by their intended victims.  They infect these sites with malware or malicious code, waiting for unsuspecting users to visit and become victims of the attack.
- Tailored Pretexting/Baiting:  Unlike the more generic baiting technique mentioned earlier, tailored baiting involves creating personalized scenarios to entice specific individuals.  Social engineers conduct extensive research on their targets to gather personal information and craft persuasive messages tailored to their interests, hobbies, or professional aspirations.  By exploiting these personal connections, the attackers increase the likelihood of success.
- Quizzes and Surveys:  Social engineers leverage the popularity of online quizzes and surveys to extract personal information from users.  These seemingly innocent quizzes often ask questions that can reveal valuable details for an attacker, such as pet names, birthdates, or favorite movies.
- Impersonation of Friends or Colleagues:  Leveraging publicly available information on social media, attackers impersonate friends, colleagues, or acquaintances to gain the trust of their targets and extract sensitive data.
USB Baiting:  In physical settings, attackers intentionally drop infected USB drives in public places, relying on the curiosity of individuals who find them and plug them into their devices, unknowingly infecting their systems.  This used to be a more widely used attack vector until organizations and the government started restricting USB drives.  However, it has become more uncommon to the point of being more effective again.  Especially as it related to people’s personal laptops/PCs.
- Social Media Exploitation:  Social engineers exploit information shared on social media platforms to craft convincing scenarios.  By analyzing posts, pictures, and connections, they can construct plausible pretexts tailored to the victim’s interests and relationships.
- Influence Manipulation:  Some attackers focus on gaining influence over specific individuals, either by building relationships over time or by exploiting existing relationships.  Once trust is established, they can use this influence to sway decisions or gain access to sensitive data.  Think along the lines of a long con when it comes to influence manipulation.
