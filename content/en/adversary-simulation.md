# ADVERSARY SIMULATION

## Vulnerability scanning is NOT a PenTest
 It is crucial for everyone to understand that a vulnerability assessment should not be mistaken for a penetration test. We, as passionate practitioners, are concerned by the vast misrepresentation of penetration tests within the market and the false sense of fortitude they provide. Our goal is to provide our customers with clarity and understanding around all that we do and that authentic penetration tests are valuable to organizations.

## Compliance and Scoped 

The final component of the adversaryâ€™s playbook is their tenacious technical ability aimed at your technology. BuddoBot examines your entire threat profile to identify vulnerabilities that could accomplish adversary objectives. This includes applications, cloud, infrastructure, mobile, and more. While our goal is to accomplish a defined shared objective with the customer, our manual red team testing can uncover a vast gamut of security vulnerabilities. There are two components of this testing: our in-house developed security automation and our exceptional Offensive Security Engineers.

## Infrastructure Penetration 

When handed an external network range, our Offensive Security Engineers start with complete server and port level analysis. Each identified service is checked for patch levels and CVEs, credentialed access, and misconfigurations based on the service. Special attention is given to:
- Remote administration services and protocols (VPN, SSH, RDP, FTP, IKE, ++)
- Technology administration web panels
- Cloud infrastructure configurations (Azure, GCP, AWS)
- Mail services (relays, OWA, O365)
- Known breached credentials

## Web Application Penetration 

When hacking web applications, the golden standard is covering things like the OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities, using the OWASP Testing Guide. While we identify these vulnerabilities, we have also developed an in-house methodology for application testing that goes far beyond those resources.
